Coke
====

Coke is a game experiment written in CoffeeScript/JavaScript, using HTML5's
`canvas` element for rendering.

## Online demo

Check it out at [http://mybuddymichael.github.com/coke/](), which is always
in-sync with `master`. Usage requires a modern browser with support for the
`<canvas>` element.

## Local installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/mybuddymichael/coke.git
    $ cd coke
    $ open index.html
